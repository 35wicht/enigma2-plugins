11/2012 - We now have a global plugin translation functionality,
	  which makes the old individual (per plugin) translations obsolete.
	  Once all plugins have been migrated, we are planning to add a translation
	  webinterface for enigma2-plugins like the one enigma2 has.



			Guidelines for adding translation support to your plugin:

1. Write all your strings that should be translated in English!

2. Use _() to mark your strings inside python files as translatable for gettext e.g. _("My translatable string")
   Note: use \" for quotation inside python files.

3. XML Files are also parsed and the tags: "text", "title", "value", "caption"
   also "shortdescription" and "description" from the plugin meta.xml will be included.
   Note: use &quot; for quotation inside xml files.

4. Add your new plugin to PYSRC and XMLSRC into po/Makefile.am.

5. Build enigma2-plugins with the --with-po configure option (see below).
   Your translatable strings should now be included inside the new global translation files.

6. Commit your changes.


			Migration Guide:

1. Add your plugin to PYSRC and XMLSRC into po/Makefile.am.

2. Rebuild enigma2-plugins with the --with-po configure option (see below).
   Your translatable strings should now be included inside the new global translation files.
	 
3. Merge your old translations into the new global translation files.
   Run: make -f doc/TRANSLATIONS.mak migrate PLUGIN=yourpluginfoldername

4. Remove the yourplugin/po/Makefile entry from configure.ac and the po subfolder inside yourplugin/Makefile.am

5. Remove all gettext imports (e.g.: from __init__ import _  or from . import _).

6. Commit your changes.


			Build enigma2-plugins with the --with-po configure option.

1. Checkout a local copy of enigma2-plugins.git
   git clone git://schwerkraft.elitedvb.net/enigma2-plugins/enigma2-plugins.git
2. cd enigma2-plugins
3. source /home/path to your opendreambox 2.0/cross-compile.env BOXNAME (e.g. DM8000)
4. oe_autoreconf
5. oe_runconf --with-po
6. oe_runmake

Attention: Building enigma2-plugins with the --with-po configure option currently will also build and update all plugin translations
that haven't been migrated to the new translation system yet.
When committing the update, make sure you have only the po folder and your changes added to the commit.
If you encounter any problems drop us a line on IRC #enigma2 @ freenode or on the enigma2-translations mailinglist
at https://lists.elitedvb.net/mailman/listinfo/enigma2-translations.
